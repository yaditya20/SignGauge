# SignGauge
An Android Accessibility app to act as an interface between humans interacting using sign language. #AndroidDevChallenge

The Problem Statement and idea explanation:

My idea resonate to the point of having an interface to act as a translator between two humans who are trying to interact with each other, one of whom has a disability and couldnâ€™t speak/hear/see but trying to communicate using sign language and other might or might not know sign language but can understand it using this app.

The app in real-time will try to convert the sign language put up by the person into a language understood by the other person in conversation. We will use the camera to capture the real-time footage and show the live caption and maybe we will also use audio to speak out the live captioned words after converting the sign language for other humans to understand.

This will help cater to problems the community of deaf and dumps face in their life while they are trying to express their feelings/emotions but the other person is not well versed with sign language.

We will use ML to develop a model that will help convert the sign language into its equivalent form for humans to understand. We will train various models for converting the live camera footage to live caption, and recorded footage to live caption, particular images of a person posing a sign language to its equivalent form of the word.
